## How It Works üîé
![how it works](how-it-works.png)

## Features

- Auto suffix to file name
- No suffix option (for one main language)
- UTF-8 encoding. So *maybe* this will support almost all languages. :) üç∑
- Auto table of contents
    - Table of contents level options
    - Table of contents emoji **on-off** options

## How to Use

1. Make `{something}.base.md` files. See [README.base.md](README.base.md) and [example.base.md](example/example.base.md) for examples, and [Command Tags](#Command-Tags) for rules.
1. Run this python file on your project root. Then, this will search all markdowns recursively.

  ```bash
  python multilang_md.py
  ```

3. You can find the `{something}.{suffix}.md` files in the same directory. For example:

    - default: `{something}.en.md`, `{something}.kr.md`, `{something}.es.md`, ...
    - no-suffix option to `en`: `{something}.md`, `{something}.kr.md`, `{something}.es.md`, ...

4. Since this generator overwrites the auto-generated files each time, you do not have to delete them every time when you modify the `{something}.base.md`. Just run step 2 again.

## Command Tags

### Headers

Headers must be declared before the body begins.

1. **Suffix Declaration**

    Declare the language you want to use. The following example declares `en` and `kr` and others as keywords. These keywords are used as suffixes.

    ```markdown
    <!-- multilangual suffix: en, kr, fr, es, jp, cn -->
    ```

1. **Hidden Suffix** (Optional)

    The `no suffix` option can prevent the suffix from being appended when creating the file. In other words, setting `no suffix` to `en` will generate `FileName.md` instead of `FileName.en.md`. This is useful because the main `README` in **GitHub** is not recognized when it has a suffix.

    ```markdown
    <!-- no suffix: en -->
    ```

### Main Text

Everything that the parser reads after the tag below is recognized as the main text. (So you have to write the header before main).

1. **Keywords**

    1. Language Classification

        The tags that distinguish languages are written in the form `<!-- [keyword] -->`. If one keyword is recognized, it will be recognized as that keyword until another keyword is seen.

        ```markdown
        <!-- [en] -->
        <!-- [kr] -->
        <!-- [fr] -->
        <!-- [es] -->
        <!-- [jp] -->
        <!-- [cn] -->
        ...
        ```

    1. Common Section

        You can use the 'common' keyword to create a common entry for all files to be generated.

        ```markdown
        <!-- [common] -->
        ```

    1. Ignored Section

        Sometimes you do not want to include some items such as comments or TODOs in the files to be generated. If so, use the `ignore` keyword.

        ```markdown
        <!-- [ignore] -->
        ```

1. **Table of contents**

    The tags below are automatically replaced to the table of contents by the generator. The level of the table of contents can be determined through the `level` option. The highest-level of title(`# title`) is level 1 because it is `<h1>` in HTML.

    ```markdown
    <!-- [[ multilangual toc: level=2~3 ]] -->
    ```

    1. **`level` option**
        - There are four ways to mark `level`. You can change the numbers below.
            - `level=2`: Make the 2nd level to table of contents.
            - `level=2~`: Make the 2nd ~ 9th level to table of contents.
            - `level=~4`: Make the 1st ~ 4th level to table of contents.
            - `level=2~4`: Make the 2nd ~ 4th level to table of contents.
        - You can write the `table of contents` tags multiple times in one document, and also put different `level` options each time.
        - **CAUTIONüí•**: If you omit this `level`, the parser will not recognize it.
        - **CAUTIONüí•**: The `table of contents` tag automatically changes the current keyword to `common`. So this tag is also implicitly in `common`.
    2. **`no-emoji` option**
        - In rare cases, you may want to subtract emoji from the table of contents while inserting emoji in the title.üò± If you are in this situation, apply the `no-emoji` option as shown below.üòé

        ```markdown
        <!-- [[ multilangual toc: level=2~3 no-emoji ]] -->
        ```
